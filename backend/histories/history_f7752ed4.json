    "content": "The project's flow involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Data Validation**: User-entered data (name, AICTE ID, email, phone number, college name) is validated by `validate_data()` to ensure all required fields are filled and that email and phone number formats are correct [Student_Form.py:15-46].\n2.  **Data Appending**: Validated data for a person can be appended to a list of entries using `append_data()` [Student_Form.py:88-96]. The `enter_another_person_data()` function allows appending data and then clearing fields for a new entry [Student_Form.py:99-101].\n3.  **PDF Generation Confirmation**: The user is prompted to confirm PDF generation via `confirm_generate_pdf()` [Student_Form.py:74-77].\n4.  **PDF Generation**: If confirmed, `generate_pdf()` is called. This function first validates the current data, then appends it, and finally creates a PDF file (`candidate_data_{timestamp}.pdf`) containing all collected entries [Student_Form.py:59-70].\n5.  **PDF Opening**: The generated PDF can be opened using `open_pdf()` [Student_Form.py:104-108].\n6.  **Application Closure**: The application can be closed using `close_application()` [Student_Form.py:111-112].",
