    "content": "The API key authentication works as follows:\n1.  You set a secret password (API key) on your server.\n2.  Clients must include this password in the `X-API-Key` header with every request.\n3.  The server checks if the provided password matches the configured `RAG_API_KEY`.\n4.  If the key matches, the server allows access; otherwise, it denies access (e.g., with a 401 status).\n\nThis process involves a client (your app) sending a request with the `X-API-Key` to the server (FastAPI), which then validates the key before potentially forwarding the request to a RAG Agent (Gemini).

This process clones the repository, extracts and chunks source files, builds BM25 and FAISS indexes, and saves them to the `indexes/` directory. [QUICKSTART.md:20-27]\n2.  **Ask Questions**: After indexing, you can ask questions about the repository using a command like `python cli.py ask \"How does authentication work?\" -r https://github.com/user/repo`. [QUICKSTART.md:29-30]\n3.  **Interactive Chat**: For a continuous conversation, you can use the interactive chat mode with `python cli.py chat -r https://github.com/user/repo`. In this mode, the system retrieves relevant code chunks, generates answers using Gemini, shows source citations, and maintains conversation history. [QUICKSTART.md:32-39]",

The context lists these files but does not detail any specific directory structure or other project files within this repository. [README.md:51-111]\n\n2.  **The `rag_agent` project (implied from `rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md`, `API_KEY_GUIDE.md`, `AZURE_DEPLOY.md`):**\n    This project has a more defined structure, including both its own source/configuration files and generated output directories:\n    *   **Generated Output Structure**: After indexing, the `rag_agent` creates:\n        *   `indexes/`: Contains subdirectories for each indexed repository (`index_<hash>/`). Each `index_<hash>/` includes `chunks.jsonl`, `meta.json`, and a `faiss_index/` subdirectory with `index.faiss` and `index.pkl`. [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:73-80]\n        *   `histories/`: Contains chat history files (`history_<hash>.json`) per repository. [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:81-82]\n    *   **Project Files**: The context mentions several files that are part of the `rag_agent` project itself:\n        *   `requirements.txt` (for dependencies) [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:4]\n        *   `cli.py` (for command-line interface) [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:54]\n        *   `language_detect.py` (for detecting supported file types) [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:92]\n        *   `security.py` (for API key management) [API_KEY_GUIDE.md:261]\n        *   `.env` (for environment variables) [rag_agent\\QUICKSTART.md:10]\n        *   `azure-deploy.json` (for Azure deployment) [AZURE_DEPLOY.md:12]\n\nIn summary, the `beginners-C-program-examples` repository is presented as a flat list of C source files, while the `rag_agent` project has a structured organization with dedicated directories for generated data and various configuration/source files for its functionality.",
